    <h2 class="section-title">Why Tacoma Homeowners Remodel With Us</h2>
    
    <div class="content-box">
      <p>
        Tacoma’s housing stock is incredibly diverse. From North End classics to South Tacoma split-levels, no two bathrooms are the same—and neither are our remodels. We don’t believe in cookie-cutter upgrades. Every project starts with understanding your layout, your pain points, and your long-term goals.
      </p>

      <p>
        Maybe your bathroom lacks natural light. Maybe it was remodeled once in 1985 and hasn’t been touched since. Or maybe you're finishing a basement and need a second full bath that doesn’t feel like an afterthought. Whatever the situation, we’re here to bring form and function together—with clean execution and <a href="https://procompleteconstruction.com/our-services/structural-modifications/"> structural remodeling expertise.</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Tacoma’s permitting rules and older home quirks don’t scare us. We’ve navigated tight crawlspaces, offset plumbing, and walls that weren’t quite square—and we still deliver clean, beautiful results. <a href="https://procompleteconstruction.com/service-areas/tacoma-remodeling/" target="_blank">Learn more about our full Tacoma remodeling services</a> to see how we handle projects across the city.

    <!-- Section 1: Design Trends -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="section-title">Recent Bathroom Design Trends in Tacoma</h2>
      <p class="intro">We're seeing more homeowners in Tacoma lean into smart, timeless design—without losing the personal touch. Here are some of the top requests we’ve been getting:</p>
      <ul class="trend-list">
        <li>✅ Curbless showers with large format tile</li>
        <li>✅ Floating vanities to create the illusion of more space</li>
        <li>✅ Vintage tile nods in older homes (hex, penny round, subway)</li>
        <li>✅ Heated floors for comfort in the cooler months</li>
        <li>✅ Natural light solutions like solar tubes or wall cut-outs</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">We also see homeowners pairing their <a href="https://procompleteconstruction.com/our-services/discover-bathrooms/"> bathroom upgrades </a>with other projects—like <a href="https://procompleteconstruction.com/our-services/discover-kitchens/">kitchen remodels</a>  or <a href="https://procompleteconstruction.com/our-services/home-addition/"> home additions</a>—to maximize long-term value.</p>

    <div class="section structural-box">
      <h3 class="sub-title " style="text-align: center;">Not Just Cosmetic: We Handle Structural Bathroom Work Too</h3>
      
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>✔️ Many Tacoma bathrooms—especially in older homes—weren’t built to support modern layouts, fixtures, or plumbing loads. That’s where our structural remodeling experience sets us apart.</li>
        <li>✔️ Whether you're moving a wall, raising a ceiling, reinforcing joists under a new tub, or dropping in a bathroom where none existed (like a basement), we make sure your home is structurally sound—not just pretty on the surface.</li>
        <li>✔️ We work closely with structural engineers and city inspectors when needed, so everything’s permitted, up to code, and done right the first time.</li>
